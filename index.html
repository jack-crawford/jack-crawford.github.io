                        Originally from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Jack attended Holland Hall from 2001 until 2017. (That's no
                        typo, he went to the same school from Pre-K through the twelfth grade.)
                        Jack then attended Villanova University, where he received his
                        B.S. in Computer Science. While at Villanova, Jack was the president of the Association for
                        Computing Machinery, the station manager at WXVU 89.1 FM, and the host of The Come Up every
                        Friday night from 8:30-10 PM. At the height of the pandemic, he worked with the Office of
                        the President to produce Think Negative!, a podcast that kept Villanovans on campus and around the
                        world abreast of the university's response to the crisis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a junior at Villanova, Jack began working for <a href="https://threshold.world"
                            style="color: var(--green)" target="_blank">threshold.world</a> as an intern, becoming a
                        full developer before his senior year and joining the company full-time after graduation. At
                        threshold, he leads product development on <a href="https://b.world"
                            target="_blank">b.world</a>, a platform helping nonprofits and other social impact teams to
                        manage projects, measure impact, and tell their stories.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2023, one of Jack's college roommates talked him into starting a podcast where they would
                        analyze seasons of the reality-competition show Survivor, appropriately titled <a
                            href="https://linktr.ee/survivoranalytics" target="_blank">Survivor Analytics.</a> Now in
                        its sixth season, Survivor Analytics has 17,000 followers on TikTok and counting. Multiple
                        former Survivor contestants have appeared on the show, including Survivor: China winner Todd
                        Herzog.
                    </p>
                    <p> Jack now lives in Washington D.C. with his incredible partner but without any dogs, because you
                        can only be so lucky.

                            Jack has been developing software professionally for roughly a decade, a fact that gives him
                            an existential crisis every time he remembers it.

                            Though he got his start in iOS development (back in the Swift 1.0 days), Jack's primary
                            experience is in full-stack web development. Through high school and college, he built and
                            published several experiemental platforms on his own while also working part-time as a web
                            developer. He now works full time at threshold.world, where he leads development on their
                            SaaS platform b.world. He is well-versed in .NET, PHP, Node, and plenty of other technologies.

                            By volume of work, it could be argued that Jack is a baseball writer, but he largely focuses
                            on the intersection of technology and humanity. Baseball's merely an answer to that great question.
                            His first published work examined the ethical failings in Boeing's development of the 737
                            MAX MCAS system, and how their response resembled that of the Therac-25 disaster of the
                            1980s.

                            Jack began working on his master's in creative writing and literature from Harvard
                            University in the spring of 2023, and plans to graduate in the spring of 2026. He is
                            currently revising his first novel, <i>The Whetstone</i>, which will serve as the capstone
                            of his degree.

                        <p>In addition to that and other longer works, he regularly writes an irregular sports column on
                            his Substack and occasionally publishes short fiction there. </p>

                    (African-Americans and especially African American women), and that system of oppression is enforced
                    by artificial and manufactured laws. Janie, a paragon of her caste, is deeply attuned to the
                    inevitable realities of the physical world, and as such liberates herself by realizing that the
                    man-made society can never overcome the laws of nature (including that final law, death). When she

                <p class="py-3">"The parodic nature of Ulysses creates ample opportunity for interpretation on countless
                    levels. One of the crucial dimensions of Joyce’s work to watch closely is the distance between his
                    work and the original. Though there are many parallels between the Odyssey and Ulysses, they are not
                    geometrically parallel, running on identical paths without intersection. The deviations between the
                    two are always intentional, and their implications are crucial to understanding at least a fraction
                    of Joyce’s intentions."</p>
