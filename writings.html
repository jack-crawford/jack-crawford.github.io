      <p id='para'>Our world has problems. No shit. From economic inequality to political division to the classic discriminatory -isms of gender, race, and religion, the list could go on for pages. The news reads like the bastard child of an Onion article and a Real Housewives subplot, but it's&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span>. This makes it incredibly easy to fall into an existential, but well informed, death spiral of Twitter-scrolling, page-refreshing horror. It's easy to feel powerless in the face of global warming, governmental corruption, and every other insane problem our world faces, but there are ways to stave off that crisis.&nbsp;</p>
      <p id='para'>1. Do something to help fix a problem. Obviously most of us can't reverse climate change, but we can write letters to our officials, and elect better ones. We can organize awareness campaigns, and spend our money in more environmental ways. There is always a way to contribute, and knowing you've made any difference at all can help mentally.</p>
      <p id='para'>2. Serve others, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> fight for justice. A professor recently told me a story about the difference between service and justice:</p>
      <p id='para'>A young woman begins college, attending her mother's alma mater, and calls home one day. She's excited, because she's serving food at the same homeless shelter her mom served at in her college days 20 years earlier, and the people running the shelter remember the mom!</p>
      <p id='para'>At first glance, this is a sweet story about legacy through service in a community, and that service is unquestionably good. Feeding the homeless, giving them a place to rest, there is no doubt that service is good. However, why is there still a shelter at all? Shouldn't that shelter have closed, all their clientele having found homes and steady employment? That's where justice comes in - service takes care of those afflicted short term, justice cures the afflication.</p>
      <p id='para'>3. Practice some serious self care. Hydrate, sleep on a regular schedule, eat well, exercise, take a break from screens. Seek hygge, coziness. You won't be able to solve larger problems until you're in top form.&nbsp;</p>
      <p id='para'>Listen. Each of us has access to more information than Alexandria held, carries stronger tech than what got man to the moon, and has had (probably) more formal education that Lincoln or Hamilton. We have the collective knowledge of most of humanity at our fingertips: let's use it to fix some problems.</p>
      <p id='para'>Most of all, try. Try to do good. Try to be kind. Try to have hope. Try to make change in this troubled world. Practice makes perfect.</p>

    <div class="titleline">To Be Human </div>
    <div class = "subtitle"><i>For Computer Ethics 2180 - January 22, 2019</i></div>
    <p id='para'>Humans are glitchy, squishy pseudo-computers. Ideally, we take in sensory inputs, process them, derive meanings from them, and then use that knowledge to inform future actions (stove top gets hot, hot = bad, don’t touch stove). Instead, we make viral videos doing the exact opposite of what our brains advise. Our brains keep our intestinal trains on time, our breathing steady, and our sleeping forms still in sleep, but at the same time allow us to fall in unrequited love, procrastinate on our work, and order large fries while knowing full well they have no nutritional value. We try to make decisions wisely, try to weigh our options, yet end up going with our gut feelings. Those gastrointestinal instincts drive us, make us impulsive, and make us random. We run on algorithms that factor in superstition.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>While our emotional responses may stem from chemicals released in our minds, they are greater than the sum of their parts, just as the written word is more than just ink on paper. Those chemicals, felt as emotions, influence actions with far less logic than past experiences and knowledge might. Two lactose intolerant people go to the same burger joint for lunch. They both know that, if they order a milkshake, they will experience some… distress. One of them has spent the morning happily with friends and family, the other’s just been dumped. The newly single one is far more likely to seek solace in a sugary dairy product than the other, while knowing full well that they will regret it later on. We humans are willing to knowingly but illogically sacrifice our long term good for short term satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>To be human is to organize, to form clans, governments, and softball teams, to join churches and gyms. We do these because we find comfort in flying the same flag as those around us, in belonging to something larger. This need may come from the days when people found that living in groups worked as lion repellent, but regardless this need to assemble is so essential it’s protected in the Bill of Rights.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>Computers are built for a purpose. Originally they were built to compute (hence the name) large numbers, but since they’re really good at that, we’ve placed layer upon layer over the 1s and 0s until they play music, run games, and communicate across the globe. Computers can perform a multitude of tasks, but they are built to do them. Humans, on the other hand, evolved. Whether or not we were designed by a higher power (an debate I will absolutely not get into here), we inarguably evolved from lower life forms. We grew thumbs to handle tools, began to walk upright to gain more visibility, and at some point, as Douglas Adams put it, became “ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea”. Somewhere between learning to use fire and discovering the wheel, we transcended the parameters of our design. We began to tell stories, we conceived society, and we began looking for God. None of these actions would make sense if performed by lower animals or computers (they’d actually seem rather startling), but they seem perfectly logical when done by humans. In our narcissism (another uniquely human trait) we think we are of a higher form than computers. Computers can perform complex operations faster than we can write them down, but they cannot feel. They can learn, but slowly. They are logical to a fault, where we know that some games can only be won by not playing.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>We humans are deceptively simple, running on basic instincts that can be reduced to algorithms yet motivated by ideals and emotions that cannot be captured numerically. Yet.
