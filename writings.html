    <div class="subtitle"><i>A bouncy new comp for Overwatch - March 6, 2019 </i></div>
    This is Baptiste:</br>

    He's a new support hero recently added to Overwatch. His kit is outlined in the video above. Between his immortality field, healing grenades, and damage-doubling ultimate, Baptiste is looking like a formidable new support hero. However the one ability that I think could be really useful is his Exo Boots, which allow the player to charge a super jump and fly up high. Assuming that he'll leave the Test Region in a similar state to the one he's in now (who knows), that super jumping could be what the game needs for a new, interesting meta. Watching the Overwatch League, at least Stage 1 of Season 2, means watching two teams compete for the best three-three, or GOATs, composition. At best, that's fine. The teams almost always run identical hero lineups, and on some level it's actually a good thing, because new viewers aren't being overwhelmed by too many different heros and abilities. For most people, however, it's getting boring! Every match is just GOATs because that's the most effective comp right now, but it may not be for long!
    (If you don't know what GOATs is, click <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/25/18239845/overwatch-goats-meta-triple-tank-explainer">here.</a>)
    I think that GOATs MAY be unseated, at least on maps with good vertical potential, by a new comp (which I frankly haven't tested yet) that takes advantage of high ground and uses mobile, damage boosting healers to do so. </br>

    Here's my proposed hero list for this comp:
  </br> <b>Supports</b>
    <ul>
      <li> Baptiste - between his damage boosting ult, healing grenades, and immortality field (useful for grav/bomb combos), as well as his vertical capability, he'll be able to heal more people at a time than Zenyatta while sustaining team fights and dismantling enemy ults, ALL with the added bonus of the vertical mobility that Zen just doesn't have. Floating just isn't enough sometimes!
      </li>
      <li> Mercy - she's got damage boosting, healing, and resurrection for those unlucky teammates who miss out on the immortality field, plus the mobility to follow the team up and around fast jumps.
      </li>
      <li> Lucio - more useful on offense, Lucio can help speed an attacking team into the high ground and, ideally, get some clutch boops at the same time to help claim it.

    <div class="titleline">To Be Human </div>
    <div class = "subtitle"><i>For Computer Ethics 2180 - January 22, 2019</i></div>
    <p id='para'>Humans are glitchy, squishy pseudo-computers. Ideally, we take in sensory inputs, process them, derive meanings from them, and then use that knowledge to inform future actions (stove top gets hot, hot = bad, don’t touch stove). Instead, we make viral videos doing the exact opposite of what our brains advise. Our brains keep our intestinal trains on time, our breathing steady, and our sleeping forms still in sleep, but at the same time allow us to fall in unrequited love, procrastinate on our work, and order large fries while knowing full well they have no nutritional value. We try to make decisions wisely, try to weigh our options, yet end up going with our gut feelings. Those gastrointestinal instincts drive us, make us impulsive, and make us random. We run on algorithms that factor in superstition.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>While our emotional responses may stem from chemicals released in our minds, they are greater than the sum of their parts, just as the written word is more than just ink on paper. Those chemicals, felt as emotions, influence actions with far less logic than past experiences and knowledge might. Two lactose intolerant people go to the same burger joint for lunch. They both know that, if they order a milkshake, they will experience some… distress. One of them has spent the morning happily with friends and family, the other’s just been dumped. The newly single one is far more likely to seek solace in a sugary dairy product than the other, while knowing full well that they will regret it later on. We humans are willing to knowingly but illogically sacrifice our long term good for short term satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>To be human is to organize, to form clans, governments, and softball teams, to join churches and gyms. We do these because we find comfort in flying the same flag as those around us, in belonging to something larger. This need may come from the days when people found that living in groups worked as lion repellent, but regardless this need to assemble is so essential it’s protected in the Bill of Rights.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>Computers are built for a purpose. Originally they were built to compute (hence the name) large numbers, but since they’re really good at that, we’ve placed layer upon layer over the 1s and 0s until they play music, run games, and communicate across the globe. Computers can perform a multitude of tasks, but they are built to do them. Humans, on the other hand, evolved. Whether or not we were designed by a higher power (an debate I will absolutely not get into here), we inarguably evolved from lower life forms. We grew thumbs to handle tools, began to walk upright to gain more visibility, and at some point, as Douglas Adams put it, became “ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea”. Somewhere between learning to use fire and discovering the wheel, we transcended the parameters of our design. We began to tell stories, we conceived society, and we began looking for God. None of these actions would make sense if performed by lower animals or computers (they’d actually seem rather startling), but they seem perfectly logical when done by humans. In our narcissism (another uniquely human trait) we think we are of a higher form than computers. Computers can perform complex operations faster than we can write them down, but they cannot feel. They can learn, but slowly. They are logical to a fault, where we know that some games can only be won by not playing.
    </p>
    <p id='para'>We humans are deceptively simple, running on basic instincts that can be reduced to algorithms yet motivated by ideals and emotions that cannot be captured numerically. Yet.
